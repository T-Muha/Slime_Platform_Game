# Slime_Platform_Game
A simple platformer demo built with Python and the Pyglet library
Technically qualifies as a game engine. Wrote physics/movement from scratch using the Pyglet clock.


To run: download the files (same location with current branch structure) , install the pyglet module, and run slime.py

More will be added later.
